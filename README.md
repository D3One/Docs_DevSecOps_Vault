# DevSecOps & AppSec Knowledge Vault üîê‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to my open-source repository dedicated to the practical world of DevSecOps, Application Security, and Cloud Security. This is a curated collection of materials, notes, and tools accumulated during my tenure as a DevSecOps and AppSec Engineer.

This repository is designed to be a hands-on guide for engineers, providing real-world examples, configurations, and insights to help you build more secure, robust, and automated systems from code to cloud.

> **Disclaimer:** This repository contains materials for **educational and informational purposes only**.
> *   The eBooks are provided for personal review and exploration. Please support authors by purchasing official copies if you find them valuable.
> *   Always test configurations and commands in a non-production environment first. The examples are provided "as-is."
