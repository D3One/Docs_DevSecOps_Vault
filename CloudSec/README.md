## üìã Overview

AWS Cloud Security refers to the practices, technologies, and policies implemented to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. This repository provides practical resources for implementing and auditing security controls across various AWS services, helping organizations maintain a strong security posture in accordance with the AWS Shared Responsibility Model .

## üõ°Ô∏è Key AWS Security Domains

Based on AWS's security framework and best practices, this repository covers these essential domains :

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** - Secure management of identities, resources, and permissions
- **Data Protection** - Encryption, key management, and sensitive data discovery
- **Threat Detection and Response** - Continuous risk identification and prioritization
- **Network and Application Protection** - Implementing detailed security policies at network control points
- **Compliance** - Automated compliance checks based on AWS best practices and industry standards

## üîç AWS Security Checklist Highlights

### IAM & Access Control
- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
- [ ] Follow the principle of least privilege for all policies
- [ ] Regularly rotate access keys and review permissions
- [ ] Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys when possible

### Data Protection
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest for EBS volumes, S3 buckets, and RDS instances
- [ ] Use AWS KMS for key management with automatic rotation
- [ ] Classify data based on sensitivity and apply appropriate protections
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS for data in transit

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail for API activity logging across all regions
- [ ] Configure AWS Config for resource inventory and change tracking
- [ ] Set up Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection
- [ ] Establish log retention policies according to compliance requirements

### Network Security
- [ ] Implement security groups with minimal open ports
- [ ] Use Network ACLs for additional subnet-level protection
- [ ] Enable VPC Flow Logs for traffic monitoring
- [ ] Secure Site-to-Site VPN connections with appropriate tunneling protocols

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Enable automated backups for critical resources (RDS, EBS, etc.)
- [ ] Test restoration procedures regularly
- [ ] Implement versioning and MFA delete for S3 buckets
- [ ] Establish Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) targets

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of AWS core services
- AWS CLI installed and configured (optional)

### Using the Checklists
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-cloud-security-essentials.git
   ```
2. Review the detailed checklists in the `/checklists` directory
3. Use the AWS Management Console or CLI commands provided to verify your configuration
4. Implement recommended security controls based on your organization's risk assessment

### Quick Audit Example
Check for unencrypted S3 buckets using AWS CLI:
```bash
aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name' --output text | xargs -I {} bash -c 'echo "Checking {}"; aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket {} 2>&1'
```
